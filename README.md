# UNICEF Data Analysis Report 📊🌍

This project is a data-driven report created for an academic assignment, using public UNICEF datasets to analyze global disparities in child healthcare, with a focus on diarrhoea treatment in children aged under 5.

## 📌 Objective

The goal of this analysis is to raise awareness of global health inequalities by exploring how treatment rates vary across countries and how these rates relate to broader development indicators such as GDP per capita and life expectancy.

## 📈 Visualizations

The report includes the following key data visualizations:
- **Bar Chart**: Top 10 countries with the highest diarrhoea treatment rates in girls under 5 (2023)
- **Scatterplot with Regression Line**: Relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy, colored by continent
- **Time-Series Chart**: Diarrhoea treatment rates over time (2011–2023) for India, Nigeria, and Pakistan
- **World Map**: Global diarrhoea treatment rates visualized geographically

## 🧪 Tools Used

- **Google Colab** for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization
- **Plotnine** (Python's version of ggplot2) for chart generation
- **GeoPandas** and **Matplotlib** for world map rendering
- **Quarto** to render a clean HTML report
- **GitHub Pages** to publish the final report online

## 📂 Files

- `Deepak_report.ipynb`: Main notebook used for all analysis and plots
- `Deepak_report.html`: Final rendered Quarto HTML report
- `.png` images: Plots exported from Colab and embedded in the HTML report
